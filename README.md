# SVM-on-Super-Smash-Bros.-Melee
My Senior Project at Winona State, with the goal of showing Support Vector Machine Learning in action on previously played Super Smash Bros. Melee games, using the works of [Project Slippi](https://github.com/project-slippi) and [Slippi-js](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-js) to extract metadata from these replay files.
